In this repository Iâ€™ll walk you through the introduction and    implementation of sorting algorithms with the Python programming    language. Sorting algorithms are categorized based on their memory    usage, complexity, recursion, whether they are based on comparisons,    among other considerations.

 - Bubble Sort 
 - Insertion Sort 
 - Selection Sort
 - Quick Sort
 - Merge Sort
